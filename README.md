This is a small [Iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced/) demo.
Each commit represents a step in [this tutorial](https://github.com/brianch/iced-twentyone-tutorial).

Some minor issues:
- The code of chapter's 9 and 10 are wrongly named 10 and 11 in the commit messages (so there's two 11s)
- The 16th chapter was divited in two commits by mistake.
